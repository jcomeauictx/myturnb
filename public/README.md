## For developers

Check for errors under `/var/log/node-myturn-api.log`, `/var/log/nginx/myturn-error.log`, and using right-click Inspect under Chromium, or similar JavaScript console functionality under other browsers.

To install this on a DigitalOcean droplet running Debian, do one of the 
following, depending on which version you want. The default version is "master",
generally the most stable:

- `sudo npm install --global --unsafe jcomeauictx/myturnb`
- `sudo npm install --global --unsafe jcomeauictx/myturnb#beta`
- `sudo npm install --global --unsafe jcomeauictx/myturnb#alpha`

There is also a `legacy` version, but that is only for developers who want to
see if a bug is new, or inherited from the previous developer's code.

When forking this project, or merging a pull request, make sure to change the
references to the repository owner (jcomeauictx in my case) to your own in this
`README.md` file and in `package.json`.
